# Challenge Lab

# Capstone Project 

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this challenge, you will work with a Chainlit-based conversational application that utilizes Dapr’s publish-subscribe (pub/sub) messaging model to orchestrate customer service escalations through intelligent AI agents. The solution seamlessly integrates several Azure services—including Azure OpenAI for natural language processing, Cosmos DB for data persistence, and Azure Service Bus for reliable messaging. When AI agents reach their resolution limits, the system intelligently escalates the case to a human support agent by triggering a Logic Apps workflow that sends an approval request via email. This hands-on lab offers valuable insight into how AI-driven conversational interfaces, event-driven architecture, and workflow automation can be combined to create responsive, scalable, and human-aware customer support systems.

## Objective 

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Multi-Agent Business Persona Workflow**: Experience a collaborative workflow involving three distinct personas—Software Engineer, Product Owner, and User. The Software Engineer writes and submits code, the Product Owner reviews and approves the changes, and upon approval, the solution is automatically pushed to GitHub for deployment and version control.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- Basic understanding of Azure services such as Azure OpenAI, and models.
- Experience with deploying applications using Azure Developer CLI (AZD).
- Exposure to conversational AI tools like Streamlit or similar frameworks.

## Explanation of Components

- **Azure OpenAI**: A cloud-based service that provides access to advanced language models, enabling natural language processing, content generation, and conversational AI capabilities. It allows you to integrate powerful AI-driven features into your applications securely and at scale.
- **Azure Container Apps**: A serverless container hosting service that allows you to deploy and scale microservices and containerized applications without managing infrastructure.
